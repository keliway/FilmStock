    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">
        <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026<br>
        <strong>App:</strong> FilmStock
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>FilmStock ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>FilmStock does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal information.</strong> All data you create in the app is stored exclusively on your device. We have no access to your data at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information Stored Locally</h2>
        <p>The following information is stored locally on your device only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Film stock inventory and details (manufacturer, type, format, speed, expiry dates, notes, roll counts, frozen status, exposure counts)</li>
            <li>Custom photos of film boxes taken with the camera or selected from your photo library</li>

            <li>Finished film records (completion dates, development status, roll details)</li>
            <li>Widget configuration data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Export and Import</h2>
        <p>FilmStock provides an optional Export &amp; Import feature (currently in beta) that allows you to export your film inventory as a JSON or CSV file. These files are created locally on your device and shared only through the standard iOS share sheet &mdash; you control exactly where they go. We do not receive copies of any exported files. Imported files are read locally and never transmitted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>
        <p>FilmStock requests the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> To take photos of your film boxes for visual reference. These photos are processed locally, cropped to square format if needed, and stored only on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> To select existing photos from your device to use as film images. Selected photos are copied into the app's local storage and never uploaded or shared.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can revoke these permissions at any time through iOS Settings. The app will continue to function without these permissions, but you won't be able to add custom images.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <p>All data processing occurs locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image cropping and resizing for film photos</li>
            <li>Filtering and sorting of your film collection</li>
            <li>Widget data updates for the home screen</li>
            <li>Statistics calculations</li>
            <li>Export file generation (JSON/CSV)</li>
            <li>Import file parsing and validation</li>
